## Abstract
> Modeling strong gravitational lenses in order to quantify the distortions of the background sources
> and reconstruct the mass density in the foreground lens has traditionally been a major computational
> challenge. As the quality of gravitational lens images increases, the task of fully exploiting the infor-
> mation they contain becomes computationally and algorithmically more difficult. In this work, we use
> a neural network based on the Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM) to simultaneously reconstruct an
> undistorted image of the background source and the lens mass density distribution as pixelated maps.
> The method we present iteratively reconstructs the model parameters (the source and density map
> pixels) by learning the process of optimization of their likelihood given the data using the physical
> model (a ray tracing simulation), regularized by a prior implicitly learnt by the neural network through
> its training data. When compared to more traditional parametric models, the method we propose is
> significantly more expressive and can reconstruct complex mass distribution, which we demonstrate
> by using realistic lensing galaxies taken from the hydrodynamical IllustrisTNG simulation .

## Software implementation

All source code used to generate the results and figures in the paper are in
the `code` folder.
The calculations and figure generation are all run inside
[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).
The data used in this study is provided in `data` and the sources for the
manuscript text and figures are in `manuscript`.
Results generated by the code are saved in `results`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.


## Getting the code

You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the
[git](https://git-scm.com/) repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO.git

or [download a zip archive](https://github.com/pinga-lab/PAPER-REPO/archive/master.zip).

A copy of the repository is also archived at *insert DOI here*


## Dependencies

You'll need a working Python environment to run the code.
The recommended way to set up your environment is through the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which
provides the `conda` package manager.
Anaconda can be installed in your user directory and does not interfere with
the system Python installation.
The required dependencies are specified in the file `environment.yml`.

We use `conda` virtual environments to manage the project dependencies in
isolation.
Thus, you can install our dependencies without causing conflicts with your
setup (even with different Python versions).

Run the following command in the repository folder (where `environment.yml`
is located) to create a separate environment and install all required
dependencies in it:

    conda env create


## Reproducing the results

Before running any code you must activate the conda environment:

    source activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME

or, if you're on Windows:

    activate ENVIRONMENT_NAME

This will enable the environment for your current terminal session.
Any subsequent commands will use software that is installed in the environment.

To build and test the software, produce all results and figures, and compile
the manuscript PDF, run this in the top level of the repository:

    make all

If all goes well, the manuscript PDF will be placed in `manuscript/output`.

You can also run individual steps in the process using the `Makefile`s from the
`code` and `manuscript` folders. See the respective `README.md` files for
instructions.

Another way of exploring the code results is to execute the Jupyter notebooks
individually.
To do this, you must first start the notebook server by going into the
repository top level and running:

    jupyter notebook

This will start the server and open your default web browser to the Jupyter
interface. In the page, go into the `code/notebooks` folder and select the
notebook that you wish to view/run.

The notebook is divided into cells (some have text while other have code).
Each cell can be executed using `Shift + Enter`.
Executing text cells does nothing and executing code cells runs the code
and produces it's output.
To execute the whole notebook, run all cells in order.
